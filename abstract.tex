\begin{abstract}
Let $u,v \in \reals^\Omega_+$ be positive
unit vectors and
$S\in\reals^{\Omega\times\Omega}_+$ be a
symmetric substochastic matrix.
For an integer $t\ge 0$, let 
$m_t = \smash{\iprod{v}{S^tu}}$, which
we view as the
heat measured by $v$ after an initial heat
configuration $u$ is let to diffuse for $t$
time steps according to $S$. 
Since $S$ is entropy improving,
one may intuit that $m_t$ should not change too
rapidly over time. We give the following formalizations
of this intuition.

We prove that
$m_{t+2} \ge m_t^{1+2/t}\!,$ an inequality
studied earlier by Blakley and Dixon 
(also ErdÅ‘s and Simonovits) for $u=v$
and shown true under the restriction $m_t\ge e^{-4t}$.
Moreover we prove that for any $\eps>0$, 
a stronger inequality 
$m_{t+2} \ge t^{1-\eps}\cdot \smash{m_t^{1+2/t}}$
holds unless
$m_{t+2}m_{t-2}\ge \delta m_t^2$
for some $\delta$ that depends on $\eps$ only.
Phrased differently, $\forall \eps> 0, 
\exists \delta> 0$ such that $\forall S,u,v$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{m_{t+2}}{m_{t}^{1+2/t}}\ge
\min\set{t^{1-\eps}, \delta\frac{m_t^{1-2/t}}{m_{t-2}}},
\quad \forall t \ge 2,
\end{equation*}
which can be viewed as a truncated 
log-convexity statement. 

Using this inequality, we answer two related
open questions in complexity theory: Any
property tester for $k$-linearity requires
$\Omega(k\log k)$ queries and the randomized
communication complexity of the $k$-Hamming
distance problem is $\Omega(k\log k)$.
Further we show that any randomized parity
decision tree computing $k$-Hamming weight has size
$\exp\nparen{\Omega(k\log k)}$.
